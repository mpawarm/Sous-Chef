Changes to prototype:

- Confirmation dialog when quitting recipe
- Recipe checkmark button now says "Done Step"
- Added step numbers to each step's title to help with navigation
  (you can find where you were more easily)
- Scroll indicator and 'Back to current step' button to help with navigation,
  clarify distinction between "Done Step" and scrolling.
- changed navbar "Recents" to "History" for consistency with that
  screen's title.
